            <h3 id="smallerTitle">What Is Ecosystem Restoration?</h3>
            <p>Ecosystem restoration is the act of bringing the native flora and fauna back to an area, this can be done in a lot of ways such as: replanting trees, removing litter and other types of trash left behind, halting pollution, managing demand for natural resources and reintroducing and protecting the native wildlife. <br> <br>
            We depend on a lot of natural ecosystems to survive such as the ocean which provides a large amount of fish, however, the ocean's ecosystem is in danger as coral reefs die and more pollution makes its way into the ocean, making fishing less viable and overfishing much worse as it is globally reducing the number of fish in the ocean to a significant degree.</p>
